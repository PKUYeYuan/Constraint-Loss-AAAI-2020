=======================================

The source code and dataset for our paper "[Integrating Relation Constraints with Neural Relation Extractors](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.11493)" which is publicated at AAAI 2020.

### Methods

In this paper, we propose a unified framework to effectively integrate discrete relation constraints with neural networks for relation extraction. Specifically, we develop two approaches to evaluate how well *NRE* predictions satisfy our relation constraints in a batch-wise, from both general and precise perspectives. We explore our approach on English and Chinese dataset, and the experimental results show that our approach can help the base *NRE* models to effectively learn from the discrete relation constraints, and outperform popular *NRE* models as well as their *ILP* enhanced versions. Our study reveals that learning with the constraints can better utilize the constraints from a different perspective compared to the *ILP* post-processing method.

And the framework and experimental results are shown as follows:
